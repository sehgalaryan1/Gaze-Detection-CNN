# Gaze-Detection-CNN
This project investigates how convolutional neural networks can distinguish gaze direction in facial images, training a MobileNetV2‑based model on 5 GB of curated eye‑region data to predict whether a subject is looking at the camera or averting their gaze, and evaluating its generalization to unseen faces.
